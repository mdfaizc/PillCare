# PillCare
PillCare is a device/system for your pillbox that is connected to cloud via WiFi and keeps the record of your daily medicine intake through website and android app 
and sends an E-mail/Message to the doctor/Hospital to book an appointment when the box gets empty.  It has two sensors that are connected to Cloud through Wifi.  
It keeps record in the form of Charts and tables so that it can be visualize by the doctor easily.
We have also made a Website  where a doctor can visualize the whole data. 
we  have even created a Mobile interface to enable the patient to visualize the data easily.  
It automatically sends an Email/Message to the doctor/hospital to book next appointment when the medicine inside the box is over and the box gets empty.
A SIMPLE HEALTHCARE DEVICE THAT HAS A BIG POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WHOLE THING..
